# MCRO
A C++23 templating and utilities Unreal Engine plugin, for a more civilized age.

### [Documentation](https://mcro.de/mcro)

### [Source code](https://github.com/microdee/mcro)

</div>

---

This repository is a distributable version of MCRO which doesn't require extra tooling ([Nuke.Unreal](https://github.com/microdee/Nuke.Unreal)) to build. [Find the source-code here](https://github.com/microdee/mcro).

## Who is this library for?

MCRO (pronounced 'em-cro') is made for C++ developers who may view Unreal Engine as a C++ framework first and as a content creation tool second. It is meant to support development of other plugins, so MCRO on its own has no primary purpose, but to provide building blocks for its dependant plugins.

It also embraces quite elaborate C++ techniques involving templates and synergic combination of language features. The documentation also makes some effort explaining these techniques when used by MCRO, but the library users themselves don't need to go that deep, in order to enjoy many features of MCRO.

## Usage

Submodule or put this plugin into your code project as regular.

Fab compatible dependency strategy is planned.
