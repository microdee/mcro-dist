		 *	@remarks
		 *	Unless `bAsync` is set in the arguments, calling this function from any thread will also block the main
		 *	thread while the modal window containing the error is open. If the calling thread also needs to be blocked
		 *	then simply wait on the returned future.
		 *
		 *	@todo
		 *	Add ability to let the user "ignore" errors, and continue execution, because they know better.
