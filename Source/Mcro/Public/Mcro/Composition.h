	/**
	 *	@brief  A base class which can bring type based class-composition to a derived class
	 *
	 *	This exists because indeed Unreal has its own composition model (actors / actor-components) or it has the
	 *	subsystem architecture for non-actors, they still require to be used with UObjects. `IComposable` allows
	 *	any C++ objects to have type-safe runtime managed optional components which can be configured separately for
	 *	each instance.
	 *
	 *	The only requirement for components is that they need to be copy and move constructible (as is the default with
	 *	plain-old-C++ objects, if they don't have members where either constructors are deleted or inaccessible). This
	 *	limitation is imposed by `FAny` only for easier interfacing, but the API for managing components will never move
	 *	or copy them by itself.
	 *	The composable class doesn't have that limitation.
	 *
	 *	Usage:
	 *	@code
	 *	//// Given the following types we want to use as components:
	 *	
	 *	struct FSimpleComponent { int A = 0; };
	 *	
	 *	struct IBaseComponent { int B; };
	 *	
	 *	//                                | This allows us not repeating ourselves, more on this later
	 *	//                                V
	 *	struct FComponentImplementation : TInherit<IBaseComponent>
	 *	{
	 *		FComponentImplementation(int b, int c) : B(b), C(c) {}
	 *		int C;
	 *	};
	 *	
	 *	struct IRegularBase { int D; };
	 *	
	 *	//                         | We have to repeat this if we want to get components with this base class
	 *	//                         V
	 *	struct FRegularInherited : IRegularBase
	 *	{
	 *		FRegularInherited(int d, int e) : D(d), E(e) {}
	 *		int E;
	 *	};
	 *	
	 *	//// Given the following composable type:
	 *	
	 *	class FMyComposableType : public IComposable {};
	 *	
	 *	//// Declare their composition at construction:
	 *	
	 *	auto MyStuff = FMyComposableType()
	 *		.With<FSimpleComponent>()                 // <- Simply add components with their types
	 *		.With(new FComponentImplementation(1, 2)) // <- Or simply use new operator
	 *		                                          //    (IComposable assumes ownership)
	 *		                                          //    Because FComponentImplementation uses TInherit
	 *		                                          //    IBaseComponent is not needed to be repeated here
	 *		.With(new FRegularInherited(3, 4))        //
	 *		    .WithAlias<IRegularBase>()            // <- FRegularInherited cannot tell automatically that it
	 *		                                          //    inherits from IRegularBase so we need to specify
	 *		                                          //    that here explicitly in case we want to get
	 *		                                          //    FRegularInherited component via its base class
	 *	;
	 *	
	 *	//// Get components at runtime:
	 *	
	 *	int a = MyStuff.Get<FSimpleComponent>().A; //
	 *	// -> 0                                    //
	 *	int b = MyStuff.Get<IBaseComponent>().B;   // <- We can get the component via base class here, only
	 *	// -> 1                                    //    because it was exposed via TInherit
	 *	int d = MyStuff.Get<IRegularBase>().D;     // <- We can get the component via base class here, because
	 *	// -> 3                                    //    we explicitly specified it during registration
	 *	FVector* v = MyStuff.TryGet<FVector>();    // <- If there's any doubt that a component may not have
	 *	// -> nullptr; FVector wasn't a component  //    been registered, use TryGet instead.
	 *	@endcode
	 *	
	 *	As mentioned earlier, components are not required to have any arbitrary type traits, but if they inherit from
	 *	`IComponent` or `IStrictComponent` they can receive extra information when they're registered for a composable
	 *	class. The difference between the two is that `IComponent` doesn't mind if it's attached to a composable class
	 *	it doesn't know about, however it is a compile error if an `IStrictComponent` is attempted to be attached to
	 *	an incompatible class.
	 *	
	 *	For example
	 *	@code
	 *	//// Given the following types we want to use as components:
	 *	
	 *	struct FChillComponent : IComponent
	 *	{
	 *		void OnCreatedAt(FExpectedParent& to) {}
	 *	};
	 *	
	 *	struct FStrictComponent : IStrictComponent
	 *	{
	 *		void OnCreatedAt(FExpectedParent& to) {}
	 *	};
	 *	
	 *	//// Given the following composable types:
	 *	
	 *	class FExpectedParent : public IComposable {};
	 *	class FSomeOtherParent : public IComposable {};
	 *	
	 *	//// Declare their composition at construction:
	 *	
	 *	auto MyOtherStuff = FExpectedParent()
	 *		.With<FChillComponent>()  // OK, and OnCreatedAt is called
	 *		.With<FStrictComponent>() // OK, and OnCreatedAt is called
	 *	
	 *	auto MyStuff = FSomeOtherParent()
	 *		.With<FChillComponent>()  // OK, but OnCreatedAt won't be called.
	 *		
	 *		.With<FStrictComponent>() // COMPILE ERROR, CCompatibleComponent concept is not satisfied because
	 *		                          // FSomeOtherParent is not convertible to FExpectedParent at
	 *		                          // OnCreatedAt(FExpectedParent& to)
	 *	;
	 *	@endcode
	 *	
	 *	Explicit components can explicitly support multiple composable classes via function overloading or templating
	 *	(with deduced type parameters).
	 *	
	 *	If a component type uses `TInherit` template or has a `using Bases = TTypes<...>` member alias in a similar way:
	 *	@code
	 *	class FMyComponent : public TInherit<IFoo, IBar, IEtc>
	 *	{
	 *		// ...
	 *	}
	 *	@endcode
	 *	Then the specified base classes will be automatically registered as component aliases. When this is used for
	 *	explicit components, `IComponent` or `IStrictComponent` is strongly discouraged to be used in `TInherit`'s
	 *	parameter pack. So declare inheritance the following way:
	 *	
	 *	@code
	 *	class FMyComponent
	 *		: public TInherit<IFoo, IBar, IEtc>
	 *		, public IComponent
	 *	{
	 *		// ...
	 *	}
	 *	@endcode
	 *
	 *	@todo
	 *	OnCopiedAt and OnMovedAt doesn't seem reliable currently, the best would be if we could provide a safe way to
	 *	keep components updated about their parents, with erasing the parent type on IComposable level, but keeping it
	 *	fully typed with components.
	 *	
	 *	@todo
	 *	C++ 26 has promising proposal for static value-based reflection, which can gather metadata from classes
	 *	or even emit them. The best summary I found so far is a stack-overflow answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/77477029
	 *	Once that's available we can gather base classes in compile time, and do dynamic casting of objects without
	 *	the need for intrusive extra syntax, or extra work at construction.
	 *	Currently GCC's `__bases` would be perfect for the job, but other popular compilers don't have similar
	 *	intrinsics. Once such a feature becomes widely available base classes can be automatically added as aliases for
	 *	registered components.
