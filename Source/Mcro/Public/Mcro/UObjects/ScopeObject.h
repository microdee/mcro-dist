	 *	@brief
	 *	A struct to emulate regular C++ RAII object behavior with UObjects. When this struct is instantiated the given
	 *	object type is also created. An object wrapped in this struct is never invalid, and doesn't get garbage
	 *	collected until it's in scope.
	 *
	 *	It is safe to create this struct on any thread, GC is deferred until constructor is finished. The underlying
	 *	storage is a `TStrongObjectPtr`.
	 *
	 *	If the given object type happen to have an `Intialize` member method, that's also called with the extra
	 *	arguments provided in the constructor.
